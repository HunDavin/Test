                <h2>Agency Debit Memos Policy</h2>
                <p>Effective 25th December 2020</p>
                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>Cambodia Airways has decided to publish its policy on Agency Debit Memos (ADM) to Travel Agents to
                    make clear the circumstances under which an ADM will be issued and the guidelines that Cambodia
                    Airways applies</p>
                <h4>Key Points of Cambodia Airways Policy</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>An ADM will be issued through the BSP only within nine months of final travel.</li>
                    <li>A floor limit of USD5 applies to an ADM, but see 2.3 for exceptions for recurring Occurrences of
                        underpayment. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>See below for full details of Cambodia Airways ADM policy.</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Scope</h4>
                        <p>Cambodia Airways will issue an ADM to collect amounts or make adjustments to agent
                            transactions related to the issuance and use of Cambodia Airways traffic documents, issued
                            by, or at the request of the Agent, regardless of which airlines are included in the
                            itinerary of the Cambodia Airways traffic document. An ADM may also be used to collect
                            amounts where a traffic document has not been issued, if agreed with the Agent, for example,
                            for deposits for group sales.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Cambodia Airways Practice</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>An ADM will only be submitted for processing through the BSP to adjust sales if issued
                                within nine months of final travel, or when the final travel date cannot be established,
                                the expiry date of the document. To adjust refunds, an ADM will only be issued within
                                nine months of the BSP remittance date on which the document was settled. For any charge
                                due beyond this period, Cambodia Airways will agree with the Agent bilaterally the best
                                settlement method and only submit an ADM through the BSP process if agreed in writing by
                                the Agent.</li>
                            <li> Cambodia Airways complies with local BSP procedures in providing Agents with a minimum
                                period of notice, in order to review any ADM and dispute it.</li>
                            <li>An ADM will not be issued for a value less than USD 5.00 or equivalent. However, if
                                there is a persistent practice of under-payment (multiple occurrences of under payments
                                less than USD 5.00 or equivalent) by the same Agent (IATA location), Cambodia Airways
                                may raise an ADM to recover the under-payments.</li>
                            <li>Cambodia Airways will endeavor to provide as much information as possible on an ADM to
                                ensure it is specific in its detail about the reason a charge is being made.</li>
                            <li>Cambodia Airways will only include more than one transaction on any ADM if the reason
                                for the charge is the same and will provide details with the ADM.</li>
                            <li>If Cambodia Airways raises an ADM for non-compliance with fare rules, the general
                                principle applied is to raise the fare to the next applicable fare. Any divergence from
                                this principle (e.g. a fixed amount penalty charge) is communicated to the Agent in
                                advance, e.g. through notes in the fare rules, by letter or any other communication
                                (e.g. Travel Trade) used in the market in question.</li>
                            <li>If the Agent does not comply with Cambodia Airways Payment policy communicated in the
                                Travel Agency Addendum, Cambodia Airways will issue an ADM </li>
                            <li>Cambodia Airways will only issue more than one ADM in relation to the same original
                                ticket, if different, unrelated charges apply (This does not apply when an ADM is
                                cancelled and raised again for the same reason but for a different value) .</li>
                            <li>Cambodia Airways will endeavor to handle a rejected or disputed ADM in a timely manner.
                                Where an Agent has disputed an ADM within the dispute period, provided the dispute was
                                sent to the email notified on the ADM in question, Cambodia Airways will acknowledge
                                receipt of the Agent’s dispute, either via a status change in BSPlink or through a
                                separate communication and stop the submission of the ADM onto the Agent’s billing
                                analysis. If Cambodia Airways reject the dispute an explanation for the rejection will
                                be sent to the Agent.</li>
                            <li>Agents with BSPlink access may dispute an ADM via their BSPlink dispute facility within
                                the ADM dispute period. If Cambodia Airways do not agree with the dispute, an
                                explanation will be communicated to the agent prior to rejection of the dispute on
                                BSPlink. The communication will give the agent a time period within which to respond
                                with additional information for Cambodia Airways to re-investigate the dispute. If no
                                response is received by Cambodia Airways within the time period indicated in the
                                communication, the ADM will be submitted for settlement to BSPlink.</li>
                            <li>
                                If an Agent disputes an ADM after it has been included in the BSP settlement Cambodia
                                Airways will:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Within 30 days of the receipt of the dispute acknowledge receipt to the Agent.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Investigate and communicate their decision on the dispute within 30 days from
                                        the date of receipt of the dispute. In circumstances where the Agent has
                                        furnished insufficient information to support the dispute or the airline
                                        decision is subject to further commercial consideration, Cambodia Airways will
                                        communicate their decision no later than 2 months from the date of receipt of
                                        the dispute.<br>For any unresolved disputes Cambodia Airways reserves the right
                                        to deduct the disputed amount from any applicable incentives payable to the
                                        Agent.</li>
                                    <li>Cambodia Airways will levy an ADM administration fee of USD5.00 (or equivalent
                                        in local currency) identified by the MF fee（Handling Fee） on the ADM. This
                                        charge will be reversed only upon full acceptance of the dispute for invalid ADM
                                        issuance by Cambodia Airways.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Cambodia Airways’ expectation from travel agents</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To train their staff in ADM procedures; their purpose and the dispute period that exists
                            </li>
                            <li>To ensure that when an ADM is disputed, the response is specific in detail and the
                                relevant supporting information is sent to Cambodia Airways to the Email address
                                indicated on the ADM.</li>
                            <li>Not to dispute an ADM where the reason is valid and evidence to the contrary is not
                                available.</li>
                            <li> To raise all disputes within the BSP dispute period (according to Resolution 850m).
                            </li>
                            <li>To ensure that their contact details (Email addresses, phone numbers, and fax numbers
